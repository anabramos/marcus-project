More importantly, there is a cinema next door.

Instead you find more North American people inside and you hear a lot more English white noise inside. I used to use Starbucks as my escape when the Dutch became too Dutch and when the office became too stifling. I found the inside atmosphere of Starbucks would calm me down enough and made me feel more at home. It was the closes culture to what I had grown up with in Dubai. I’d go in sometimes have a nice cry with my coffee and then come back to the office. I always knew id never ever run into any office colleagues in there. It was my safe space."
